# VerbRootAnalysis

This code does an analysis on isiZulu and isiXhosa verb roots 
Below is a list of the analysis done:

1. Check which verb roots end in 'is', 'el', 'w', 'an' and any combination keeping the order, like isel, iselan, elan, ...
2. Check what the roots are without the endings mentioned in 1 and which of the roots are those that have one or more of those endings
3. Percentage of extended roots which are already in the dictionary
